# soapbox-race-serverstatus
Created by CountySheriff. Retrieves all server information for the current SoapBox Race World servers.

Two files are included to make the functionality work and look nice...
--Serverstyle.css styles the Json data into 3 separate "boxes" for the 3 separate available servers with data.
--Server.php retrieves all of the data and exports it into Json format.
